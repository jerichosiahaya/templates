      <h1>The Benefits of Blogging</h1>

      <!-- Paragraph, pictures or videos goes here  -->
      <p>The world is so careful about internet safety that you wouldn't think that blogging would be a tool to expand
        a
        student's mind. However, blogging can provide several benefits.</p>
      <h2>Promotion of Self-Expression</h2>
      <p>Student blogging gives them a platform to explore their feelings about a topic. While it is often an
        educational topic, the students still know others will read it. The fact that they are providing information to
        others will give them a need to create good information since it opens them to criticism.
      </p>
      <p>Blogs can also let students explore areas that they really enjoy, like fashion or art. By sharing their
        thoughts, they are learning how to express themselves to the world. Some of the best blogs for students to read
        are those written by fellow students in similar situations or with similar interests.</p>

          alt="">
      </div>
      <h2>Sharpening Creative Thinking</h2>
      <p>Blogging allows you to think about a topic creatively. In a classroom, students may be blogging about the same
        issue or sharing their thoughts on a topic. Since they are trying to develop original writing, they will need to
        use problem solving and perspective to provide their own unique take.</p>
      <h2>Improving Writing and Communication Skills</h2>
      <p>Writing! You can't blog without writing. While some students might dread writing, the fact that they are
        creating content that goes out onto the web can make it fun. They will improve their written communication
        skills without even thinking about it.</p>
